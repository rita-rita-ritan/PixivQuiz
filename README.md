## What I'v done and what I'll do
It is currently under development, so it is not yet up and running as a service.
So far, I have <b>completed the API prototype for the backend and connected the API to the frontend</b>. The <b>next step</b> is to work on the frontend and make it a <b>more stylish page</b>. The current look of the page is as follows.
