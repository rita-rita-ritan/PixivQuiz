# PixivQuiz
PixivQuiz is a game where you look at the works in the Pixiv ranking and guess the painter.

It is currently under development, so it is not yet up and running as a service.
So far, I have <b>completed the API for the backend and connected the API to the frontend</b>. The <b>next step</b> is to work on the frontend and make it a <b>more stylish page</b>. The current look of the page is as follows.

Some people may think that there may be rights issues from the content of this web service, but I intend to implement it in a format that does not violate copyrights. If you find any rights issues, please let me know.
