# PixivQuiz
PixivQuiz is a game where you look at the works in the Pixiv ranking and guess the painter.

## What I'v done and what I'll do
It is currently under development, so it is not yet up and running as a service.
So far, I have <b>completed the API for the backend and connected the API to the frontend</b>. Now I'm implementing the <b>quiz feature</b>.
