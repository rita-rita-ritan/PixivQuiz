# PixivQuiz
PixivQuiz is a game where you look at the works in the Pixiv ranking and guess the painter.

## What I'v done and what I'll do
It is currently under development, so it is not yet up and running as a service.
So far, I have <b>completed the API prototype for the backend and connected the API to the frontend</b>. The <b>next step</b> is to implement the <b>quiz function</b>.
